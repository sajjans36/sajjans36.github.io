The RPGR is an annual international conference on “Recent Progress in Graphene and 2D Materials Research.” It covers experimental (synthesis and devices), theoretical, and computational research on 2D materials such as graphene, TMDs, and twisted bilayers/trilayers. The 14th edition is being held in Bengaluru, India. Bengaluru, often referred to as the “Silicon Valley of India,” is a technological hub and can also be considered an educational city of India. It hosts premier institutions such as the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR)-International Center of Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Raman Research Institute (RRI), Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), National Institute of Design (NID), National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), and National Law School (NLU).
