The PSI-K Conference is organized by the Psi-k community once every five years (typically in years divisible by 5). It serves as a crucial gathering for researchers and experts to share their latest findings, discuss challenges, and explore future directions in computational materials science and electronic structure research. This conference is an essential event for anyone involved in these fields. For more information, visit the official [Psi-k website](https://psi-k.net/). The PSI-K Conference 2020 was postponed to 2022 due to COVID-19 and was held at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. Switzerland's stunning landscapes, from the towering Alps to tranquil lakes, captivate visitors with their natural beauty (quite expensive tough). With a history of neutrality and cultural richness, coupled with a commitment to innovation, Switzerland embodies both timeless charm and modern development.
