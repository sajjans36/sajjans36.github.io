I am a PhD candidate at the <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.iitd.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India</a>. During my PhD, I have worked on several interesting research problems in computational spintronics and magnetism. You may want to visit [this page](/portfolio/) for more details on my research interests. The title of my PhD thesis is "Theoretical Insights to Spin Splittings and Texture in (Non-)Magnetic Materials".

I received a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Physics from the <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.iitgn.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India</a> (one of the newer IITs in India) in 2019, and a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Physics from the <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://www.du.ac.in" target="_blank">University of Delhi, India</a> in 2017. I am a *Silver Medalist* in M.Sc. for my academic performance.

Apart from academics, I follow Indian politics and cricket (other sports as well).
